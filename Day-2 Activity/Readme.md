## Day-2 Activity-1

### The CAPL Browser

The CAPL Browser provides an easy-to-use “edit-thru-compilation” development process and is used to organize,
create, edit, and modify event procedures. The CAPL Browser is more than a text editor because it not only supports
source code development - it also organizes CAPL software into a tree-like structure of events, and it has an internal
compiler.
In this programmer’s environment, we can develop new programs, import and export source files, associate a
database, and compile CAPL software. The Browser is designed to quickly edit CAPL programs, and the integrated
compiler also makes it easy to trace errors after compilation. 

##### Figure shows a general example of the CAPL Browser API.
